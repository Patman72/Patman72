# Hey, I'm Pat 👋

Aspiring **AI-powered full-stack developer** & future founder of **Auzien** – a tech/automation brand I’m building on the side while I learn and ship real projects.

I’m based in Australia 🇦🇺 and right now I’m focused on:
- 🎯 Leveling up my Python & web dev skills
- 🧠 Learning to *leverage* AI tools (not replace thinking with them)
- 🏈 Building a personal **AFL fantasy sports cruncher** for Draftstars-style contests
- 🚀 Laying the foundations for **Auzien**, my long-term tech/creator brand

---

## 🔭 What I’m working on

- **100 Days of Code (Python)**  
  Daily Python projects, games & scripts using  
  👉 [`100-Days-of-Code---The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp`](https://github.com/Patman72/100-Days-of-Code---The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp)

- **Pat’s Fantasy Sports Team Cruncher (AFL focus)**  
  Personal lineup builder for AFL contests, based on *your* logic & preferences  
  👉 [`Pats-fantasy-sports-team-cruncher`](https://github.com/Patman72/Pats-fantasy-sports-team-cruncher)  
  - Use your own reasoning and stats instead of generic tools  
  - Long-term goal: clean web UI that matches your process

- **General dev practice & experiments**  
  Small projects, exercises and practice tasks from study and tutorials  
  👉 [`Uni-projects`](https://github.com/Patman72/Uni-projects)  
  👉 [`learning-lab`](https://github.com/Patman72/learning-lab)

- **Auzien (Early-Stage Brand)**  
  - Vision: AI-powered tools, templates & automations for builders and small businesses  
  - Starting simple: learning, documenting, and shipping small web/AI projects

## 📌 Notes to my future self

- Use AI to **boost productivity**, not to skip learning.  
- Always **read & review** AI-generated code before committing.  
- Build in public when possible: share what you’re learning and making.

<!--
Optional extras you can add later:

- GitHub stats cards (e.g. from anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
- Streak stats
- Shields.io badges for tools & languages
